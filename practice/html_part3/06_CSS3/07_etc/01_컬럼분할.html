    <h2>Design</h2>
    <p>Design is the process and art of planning and making detailed drawings of something.</p>
    <p>When someone designs a garment, building, machine, or other object, they plan it and make 
    a detailed drawing of it from which it can be built or made.</p>
    <p>A creative person has the ability to invent and develop original ideas, especially in the arts.
    Creative activities involve the inventing and making of new kinds of things.</p>
    <p>If you use something in a creative way, you use it in a new way that produces interesting and unusual results.</p>
    <p>Creativity refers to the invention or origination of any new thing that has value. "New" may refer to the individual 
    creator or the society or domain within which novelty occurs. "Valuable", similarly, may be defined in a variety of ways.</p>

    <h2>Creative</h2>   
    <p>The range of scholarly interest in creativity includes a multitude of definitions and approaches 
    involving several disciplines; psychology, cognitive science, education, philosophy, technology, 
    theology, sociology, linguistics, business studies, and economics, taking in the relationship between creativity 
    and general intelligence, mental and neurological processes associated with creativity, the relationships between 
    personality type and creative ability and between creativity and mental health, the potential for fostering creativity 
    through education and training, especially as augmented by technology, and the application of creative resources to 
    improve the effectiveness of learning and teaching processes.</p>
